# Introduction

* .Net Developer
* Static language world
* NodeJs meetup, really? Javascript?
* Career change, love it
* Swamped by complexity
* Infrastructure to keep the type system happy, where is the code that does something!
* Dynamic, large is hard
* Best of both worlds

# So What is it?

* Compile to JS language
* Starts and ends with JavaScript
* Type inference, compiler works it out, sprinkle a few types
* Es6/7 features, whole bag of them which follows the spec


# Let’s look at a simple code example

* Start with a simple function
* Call with a number
* Add string type
* Show detection of failures
* Add a more complicated type
* Add an interface
* Make a class



# Why Use It

* Building large apps is hard
* Contracts between parts of code make it easier
* Refactoring
* Self documenting


# It's just JavaScript

* Your existing JavaScript is Typescript
* “mv index.js index.ts”
* For the most part your existing JavaScript is actually valid TypeScript.
* Lot’s of libraries

# Inference Example

* * Most powerful feature
* Demo hover, basic usage
* Functional example
* What other features
* Read off slide

# Alternatives / Issues
* Read off slide, first languages are not JS
* Flow is less mature, maybe better for React
* Describe issue with immutable / bluebird
